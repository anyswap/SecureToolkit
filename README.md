## secure_channel

------

A golang and nodejs implementation toolkit, aim to secure the communication channel based on Hash, Digital Signature and Encryption.

### Crypto details

+ hash: SHA-256
+ digital signature: ECDSA under curve secp256r1 (a.k.a. prime256v1)
+ encryption: symmetric encryption, AES with CTR mode

### Components

+ **secure_channel**, core implementation with test case.

+ **secure_channel_cross_verify**, cross verification between golang and nodejs, to test the **cross-language consistency**, for example, signed encrypted data generated by golang, verified by nodejs, and vice versa.


### Install and run

+ for golang, pls read [README](./golang/secure_channel/README.md).

+ for NodeJs, pls read [README](./nodejs/secure_channel/README.md).
